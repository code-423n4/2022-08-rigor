is it this bad? :/ i'm completely new so idk

Hardhat is one of the three leading Frameworks for Smart Contract Dev


[08/01/2022 9:35 PM] perrythepwner.eth
yea ik, i just saw another warden complaining about it in previous audit

I've come to like Foundry quite a bit but there's still stuff I can only do in Hardhat.

which are those? i used foundry for the first time in the fractional contest and I like it more than Hardhat already :D

I think in Hardhat I can use `console.log` a lot more easily to get a feeling for what the values of things are. In Foundry I have to add events and then look at those. I guess it's not the end of the world.

Foundry test are quicker,  you see call traces with diagrams in the terminal , you can test things faster , understand the test suite faster

There is no way to go around this than to change compile versions manually and make everything align with the openzepellin libraries,  or how were you able to compile what tricks did you use

[08/02/2022 1:24 AM] tofunmi
The problem i think is openzeppelin increased there version to 0.8.9 and your own version is 0.8.6


[08/02/2022 1:25 AM] tofunmi
Or did you run yarn install today


[08/02/2022 1:27 AM] parv3213
Just tried again. And everything works fine.


[08/02/2022 1:28 AM] tofunmi
Yep sure it would on your side


[08/02/2022 1:28 AM] parv3213
Ran this `yarn && cp .sample.env .env && yarn compile && yarn test` on a fresh repo, and everything is fine.

[08/02/2022 1:32 AM] tofunmi
I would remove node modules

Yeah, def try that. Also, maybe `yarn hardhat clean`.


[08/02/2022 1:34 AM] JohnSmith#1623
If something is not working it is a great opportunity to learn something new while fixing it, looks like I will not learn much this time 🙂


[08/02/2022 1:34 AM] tofunmi
Or maybe I should add 0.8.9 to hardahat config


[08/02/2022 1:34 AM] parv3213
Although, then compile contracts using `yarn compileCI`.

Largest tests I have ever seen wow


[08/02/2022 2:51 AM] elku.cryptos
hi @Parv , how can i run test for a single file with gas report?

For example `npx hardhat test ./test/Community.ts` doesnt work.


[08/02/2022 3:05 AM] dan13ram
can you try `yarn test test/Community.ts`


[08/02/2022 3:07 AM] dan13ram
This is a known issue in hardhat version >2.8.0 <2.9.0 
https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2220
Relative paths for running single test files creates errors and instead we must use absolute paths.


[08/02/2022 3:13 AM] elku.cryptos
this actually works with relative path.. but i want to see gas report as well.


[08/02/2022 3:13 AM] elku.cryptos
`REPORT_GAS=true` doesnt work with the above command.


[08/02/2022 4:12 AM] dan13ram
Seems like there is an issue with `hardhat-gas-reporter`. 

You can either exclude certain contracts from the report by using the `excludeContracts` option in hardhat config.
Or comment out any tests that you do not want running for the time being.

Basically gas reports seem to be working only if you test "all" files together.


[08/02/2022 4:34 AM] elku.cryptos
could you give me an example pls.. just fill two names in there please.  I am not sure of the syntax. 

```
  gasReporter: {
    enabled: REPORT_GAS === 'true',
    currency: 'USD',
    excludeContracts : []
    gasPrice: Number.parseInt(REPORT_GAS_PRICE ?? '50'),
    coinmarketcap: `${COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY || ''}`,
  },
```

  gasReporter: {

this is to isolate only "Community.sol"

i didn't understood how to create a project. i have to call createProject() in HomeFi, but first i have to initialize HomeFi. This is handled by HomeFiProxy and i have to call initiateHomeFi(), i'm right? which is asking me the address of the deployed HomeFi contract?

[08/02/2022 9:30 PM] perrythepwner.eth
now that I've deployed and initialized everything, there is some .ts that tests for creating a project? btw, i'm trying to understand what `_hash` goes into createProject()


[08/03/2022 4:02 AM] parv3213
That accepts an ipfs hash for storing any offchain detail about the project.

it accepts an hash that store whatever i want?  like https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQUCgLxwDoDeaJCJc45XWuUXh16qRYjuwn3maRitbMVdp?filename=0 or even an image?

`     ProviderError: Method personal_sign not supported.`


[08/03/2022 1:51 PM] parv3213
We are using mocha delay, that might be the reason why tests with Ganache might be failing.


[08/03/2022 1:52 PM] parv3213
This maybe some issue with the network you are using with Ganache.


[08/03/2022 1:52 PM] perrythepwner.eth
yea i think so


[08/03/2022 2:07 PM] perrythepwner.eth
which network id may solve this problem?

What is the reason for all of the override keywords ? @Parv


[08/06/2022 12:28 AM] perrythepwner.eth
what does  `'Mock on the method is not initialized'`  means?


[08/06/2022 12:29 AM] 100proof
For a basic definition of mock testing see: https://devopedia.org/mock-testing

{Reactions}
👍 

[08/06/2022 12:31 AM] 100proof
Basically it's a form of testing where you create "mock" answers for method (aka function) calls 

e.g. You could pretend that function `getLastBlockTimestamp` returned "Thursday last week" and return that


[08/06/2022 12:31 AM] 100proof
The error message is saying that no "mock" was defined for the function in question.


[08/06/2022 12:44 AM] parv3213
Because we are overriding the interfaces.

Any chance to get some stats about the contest, like how many high/med/QA/gas reports were submitted? Or are the backstagers allowed to share those numbers with us?


[08/07/2022 10:20 PM] kartoonjoy
Nah, you'll need to hold until the report is published.


[08/07/2022 10:27 PM] 0xa5df
K, thanks


[08/08/2022 10:37 PM] 100proof
The stats wouldn't be that useful anyway since the severity needs to be confirmed by the judges and sponsors


[08/08/2022 11:15 PM] 0xa5df
Yeah, but it gives you a good estimate of how was it compared to other contests


[08/08/2022 11:30 PM] 100proof
@kartoonjoy | C4 🎇🎇 could we consider releasing total number of submissions? It wouldn't really give anything away


[08/09/2022 9:56 PM] Franfran#5067
if you go on the github issues you can see a fair 90% of high being rejected

Only 4/50 were unique


[08/10/2022 1:41 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
20/50 were valid just 16/50 were dupes


[08/10/2022 1:44 PM] TurnipBoy#5973
Percentage of valid high risk is going to vary by contest, more complex protocols tend to have a lower rate because wardens misunderstand portions of the codebase

I wouldn't want to go ahead and just do that myself. Perhaps it can be a post contest statistic? To go in here perhaps? https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1002295732000264323/1005566454323761172

The repos remain private until the contest reports are published. So it's not possible to see it unless you have a backstage role.

Ah it's already public 😅 Sorry for misguiding you bro @ak1


[09/14/2022 9:36 AM] ak19966
But when i look at it.. it has only the valid and approved ..the repo does not have all the issues either they are valid or not.


[09/14/2022 9:39 AM] JohnSmith#1623
looking for this?
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/317


[09/14/2022 9:40 AM] ak19966
Exactly...


[09/14/2022 9:40 AM] ak19966
Thanks for sharing


[09/14/2022 9:47 AM] ak19966
I believe.. when the loop break.. 'i' already incremented...


[09/14/2022 9:49 AM] ak19966
That means the task index is passed without allocation


[09/14/2022 9:49 AM] ak19966
For the next cycle... It's start with next index..


[09/14/2022 9:49 AM] ak19966
One task is skipped without allocation


[09/14/2022 11:28 AM] ak19966
Looking for comments from judges. .. ofcourse others also can comment


[09/14/2022 11:29 AM] ak19966
In contest repo it was mentioned like any logic error also could be considered as bug


[09/14/2022 11:30 AM] ak19966
The secnario here is , when we assign 10 task.. out of 10, 9 only can be counted..


[09/14/2022 11:31 AM] ak19966
Ignoring or missing the one task is reasonable issue looked into.. it's housing loan kind of project... Number taks also can be counted as asset..


[09/14/2022 11:33 AM] ak19966
When 10 tasks were  assigned, each has value of 10000 units.. totally 10 * 10000 has to be allocated.. but in the logic error .. even thought the total allocation was 10 * 10000 , actually just 9 * 10000 value of work only done


[09/14/2022 11:33 AM] ak19966
Where is 10000


[09/14/2022 11:33 AM] ak19966
?


[09/14/2022 11:44 AM] minh___
you are right about that


[09/14/2022 11:44 AM] minh___
but not about that from what I can tell


[09/14/2022 11:45 AM] minh___
the first iteration is done with the value of i = lastAllocatedChangeOrderTask so dont think anything gets skipped


[09/14/2022 11:46 AM] ak19966
Yes.. it's going to start with value of i only.. but for the next cycle .. it would have missed without allocation.. that i will not participate for allocation


[09/14/2022 11:46 AM] ak19966
If you look at the codes . Same logic is done for next to this code block


[09/14/2022 11:46 AM] ak19966
There it's is handled


[09/14/2022 11:47 AM] ak19966
They would have decrement i value before assign for next round of allocation


[09/14/2022 11:53 AM] ak19966
The fact is the starting is from 0 .. not from 1


[09/14/2022 11:53 AM] ak19966
If it  start from 1 then no issue. Since it start from 0. The issue comes


[09/14/2022 12:13 PM] minh___
if you mean ` lastAllocatedTask = --j;` thats done, because there is also an increment in the loop header at the beginning: `for (++j; j <= taskCount; j++) {`


[09/14/2022 12:14 PM] minh___
you dont have that in your loop


[09/14/2022 12:16 PM] ak19966
I see..


[09/14/2022 12:16 PM] ak19966
Let me check again


[09/14/2022 12:16 PM] ak19966
What about memory allocation


[09/14/2022 12:16 PM] ak19966
?


[09/14/2022 12:18 PM] minh___
yea what about it?


[09/14/2022 12:24 PM] ak19966
uint256[] memory _tasksAllocated = new uint256[](
            taskCount - j + _changeOrderedTask.length - i
        );


[09/14/2022 12:24 PM] ak19966
Will it allocate the actual amount of memory


[09/14/2022 12:25 PM] ak19966
i is deducted here


[09/14/2022 12:26 PM] ak19966
Which mean  decremented i is more than what was required i believe


[09/14/2022 1:11 PM] ak19966
Oh man.. again this one

This is a mistake; I should have labeled it as a duplicate of both issues. Your write-up is excellent, this should even be made the primary issue of both issues, and all others can be the dups of this.

However, I'm afraid the results and final report are final, according to the C4 rules, I can not change them. I'm sorry for the trouble.
